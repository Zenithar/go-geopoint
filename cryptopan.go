// Package cryptopan implements the Crypto-PAn prefix-preserving IP address
// sanitization algorithm as specified by J. Fan, J. Xu, M. Ammar, and S. Moon.
//
// Crypto-PAn has the following properties:
//
//  * One-to-one - The mapping from original IP addresses to anonymized IP
//    addresses is one-to-one.
//
//  * Prefix-preserving - In Crypto-PAn, the IP address anonymization is
//    prefix-preserving. That is, if two original IP addresses share a k-bit
//    prefix, their anonymized mappings will also share a k-bit prefix.
//
//  * Consistent across traces - Crypto-PAn allows multiple traces to be
//    sanitized in a consistent way, over time and across locations.  That is,
//    the same IP address in different traces is anonymized to the same
//    address, even though the traces might be sanitized separately at
//    different time and/or at different locations.
//
//  * Cryptography-based - To sanitize traces, trace owners provide Crypto-PAn
//    a secret key.  Anonymization consistency across multiple traces is
//    achieved by the use of the same key.  The construction of Crypto-PAn
//    preserves the secrecy of the key and the (pseudo)randomness of the
//    mapping from an original IP address to its anonymized counterpart.
